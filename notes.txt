Notes

What do we do with an added node?
    -we give it's info in response to queries
    -we send a queries to it
    
    -so an "added node" is one we have info about
    -things like it's status, time last successful response, time sent 


When do we "add" a node?
    -put it in a bucket when it's good



Elm type of arch?
-data Msg =
    NewNode
        { info :: NodeInfo
        , timePinged :: Integer -- or whatever
        }

-update :: Msg -> ServerState -> (ServerState, Cmd Msg)


main =
  Html.program
    { init = init
    , view = view
    , update = update
    , subscriptions = subscriptions
    }

data Config model msg =
    Config
    { init :: (model, Cmd msg)
    , update :: msg -> model -> (model, Cmd msg)
    , subscriptions :: model -> Sub msg
    }

run :: Config -> IO ()
run Config { init, update, subscriptions } 


main :: IO ()
