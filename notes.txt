Maybe

Move Mainline to Network.Mainline?
Mainline/Scripts/SendUDPHello.hs to a common Runnables directory with App?
Then we have Network.{Mainline, KRPC, Bittorrent}
- but we still have all of the actual network calls under Architecture


Priority
--------

- fix non-exhaustive update function in ResolveMagnet ✓
- fix recvBuf failure (caused by recv or TCP connection failure): ✓
        Mainline: Network.Socket.recvBuf: resource vanished (Connection reset by peer)
- fix sendBuf for the same reason ✓
- Mainline: /dev/urandom: openFd: resource exhausted (Too many open files)
    - How do we know that this is caused by too many open tcp sockets?
    - How do we know this is not caused by trying to send too many things out?
    - Or a failure to write to db. Threads shouldn't be quitting unexpectedly.
- mismatch between "successfully downloaded" messsages and number of things
  in db
  - see how db errors are handled start. Then see if we can use catchIO on it. ✓
        (needs catch, not catchIO)
- store filenames in db as byte array ✓
