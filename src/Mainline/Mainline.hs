 - What are we doing here?

 - What are the two cases a KPacket can be?
 -      1. A Query (Request)
 -      2. A Response
 -      3. Error
 -
 - Query    NodeID { Ping, FindNode, AskPeers, AnnouncePeer }
 - Response NodeID { Ping, Nodes,    PeersFound Token {Values, Nodes} }
 -
 - Let's start by saying what we need to do for each case.
 - Start with case of Query:

 - Before we can implement this we need to check if a nodeid falls in the range
 - of the bucket. Need to check if toInteger Word160 is correct (our NodeIds
 - are stored how? Word32 in platform endian in big endian order.
    -- word160 is a bytestring parsed big-endian, toInteger reads big-endian
 - toInteger assumes things are stored in big endian order, but Word32 -> Integer
 - is done using fromIntegral, so it depends if fromIntegral assumes Word32 is
 - in platform endianness or not.
 -
 - Define insert and isnew separately
 - (gotcha: the spec says to discard new nodes if they don't fit into a bucket
 - full of good nodes. We respond to pings so if a new node keeps pinging us
 - this will cause us to look through the bucket each time
 -    --so what, why even write this?)
 -
 - The spec here is annoying
 -
 - When the bucket is full of good nodes, the new node is simply discarded.
 - If any nodes in the bucket are known to have become bad,
 - then one is replaced by the new node.
 -
 -      -- the new node isn't good. It just sent us a request, never a response. (it's new duh)
 -      - Good Node:
 -                              that
 -                               \/
 -          A good node is a node has responded to one of our queries within
 -              the last 15 minutes.
 -          A node is also good if it has ever responded to one of our queries
 -              and has sent us a query within the last 15 minutes.            <- For fucks sake.
 -                                                                                Is this a typo?

 -           B => (A | Q)

 -          But then we can have a good node that never sent us a Response

 - Any reason to not ping first and add a non-good node to the bucket?

 -                                                 that

 - If there are any questionable nodes in the bucket have not been seen
 -  in the last 15 minutes, the least recently seen node is pinged.
 - If the pinged node responds then the next least recently seen
 - questionable node is pinged until one fails to respond or all of the nodes
 -  in the bucket are known to be good.
 - If a node in the bucket fails to respond to a ping, it is suggested to
 -  try once more before discarding the node and replacing it with a new
 -  good node. In this way, the table fills with stable long running nodes.

 - we know it's new so we need to issue a Ping first.
